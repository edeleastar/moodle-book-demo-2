#Objectives

The labs are where you will do the real learning in this module. In Lab0-01 you will install and configure a program we will use to create and edit web site - Eclipse. We will then use this tool to create a simple multi-page web site containing a small variety of text, images and links.

In this lab we will begin a new project which will have CSS stylesheet from the beginning. We will explore some of the basic features of CSS, including colours, font and interesting techniques for setting styles across entire sections of a page.
