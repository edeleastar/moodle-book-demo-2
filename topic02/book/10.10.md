#Sidebar

We can now target this division directly with the following rule in the CSS:

~~~css
#releases
{
  border-width: thin;
  border-style: solid;
  border-color: #007e7e;
}
~~~

This establishes a suitable border (reload to see the effect). Now lets set the width:

~~~css
  width: 15,0px;
~~~

And lets further set the general dimensions:

~~~css
  padding-right: 20px;  
  padding-left: 20px;
  padding-bottom 20px;
~~~

Set a margin:

~~~css
  margin-left: 20px;
~~~

and set the text more apropriately centered:

~~~css
  text-align: center;
~~~

Our full rule is now:

~~~css
#releases
{
  border-width: thin;
  border-style: solid;
  border-color: #007e7e;

  width: 150px;
  padding-right: 20px;  
  padding-left: 20px;
  padding-bottom 20px;
  margin-left: 20px;

  text-align: center;
}
~~~

CSS enable us to shorten the structure somewhat, particularly when setting related properties. So we can replace:

~~~css
  padding-right: 20px;  
  padding-left: 20px;
  padding-bottom 20px;
~~~

with

~~~css
  padding: 0px 20px 30px 10px
~~~

Now add one more property to the same rule:

~~~css
  float: right;
~~~

Reload in browser view. This time something interesting happens the entire panel may 'float' to the right of the browser window:

![](./img/x20.png)

The actual appearance may vary depending on the browser window size.

Although this is promising, it is not quite what we were expecting. The 'releases' panel has floated left of the 'Directions' area, but is still below the main content of the home page. However, some small adjustments can realign the entire page.

First, we introduce a new division to encapsulate the main content of the home page:

![](./img/x13.png)

it is called 'maincontent'. Then we introduce a rule in the CSS to target this area:

~~~
#maincontent
{
  float:left;
  width:800px;
}
~~~

Although by no means complete yet with the 'directions' still liable to 'pop-out' unpredictably, it is possible that the page might look like this:

![](./img/x14.png)

This is the complete stylesheet:

~~~css
body
{
  font-family: Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
  font-size:small;
  line-height: 1.6em;
}

h1, h2
{
  color: #007e7e;
}

h1
{
  font-size: 150%;
}

h2
{
  font-size: 130%;
}

p
{
 color: maroon;
}

.returns
{
  border-color: white;
  border-width: 1px;
  border-style: dashed;

  margin: 30px;
  padding: 25px;
  padding-left: 80px;
  margin-right: 150px;

  background-color: #a7cece;
  background-image: url(./images/background.gif);
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: top-left;

  line-height: 1.9em;
  font-style: italic;
  font-family: Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif;
  color: black;
}

#releases
{
  border-width: thin;
  border-style: solid;
  border-color: #007e7e;

  width: 150px;
  padding: 0px 20px 30px 10px
  margin-left: 20px;

  text-align: center;

  float:right;
}

#maincontent
{
  float:left;
  width:800px;
}

        Based on real events, the dramatic thriller "Argo" chronicles the life-or-death covert operation
        to rescue six Americans, which unfolded behind the scenes of the Iran hostage crisis,
        focusing on the little-known role that the CIA and Hollywood played-information that was not
        declassified until many years after the event.
