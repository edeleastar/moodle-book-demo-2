#CSS Classes

Open the newreleases.html file in the editor and browser views.

How would we style each paragraph separately so that each new release had a different colour text? Styling the `<p>` element means that all `<p>` elements are styled in the same way. We can define a class of elements, and then apply styles to any element that belongs to that class.

Open up the newreleases.html file and go to the first paragraph. This text we want to display as red. Add an attribute called class, with an id "special" to the `<p>` element as below:

~~~html
    <h2>The Hobbit </h2>
    <p class="special">
      <img src="../images/hobbit.jpg">
      he first in a trilogy of films based on the enduring masterpiece The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien,
      The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey follows title character Bilbo Baggins,
      who along with the Wizard Gandalf and 13 Dwarves, led by Thorin Oakenshield is
      swept into an epic quest to reclaim the lost Dwarf Kingdom of Erebor from the fearsome
      Dragon Smaug.
    </p>
~~~

The paragraph above now belongs to the "special" class. We can now apply rules to that class of elements. To select a class in CSS, you write the selector like this:

~~~css
p.special
{
  color: red;
}
~~~

This allows you to select all elements that belong to a particular class. Save your html file and your css file and reload the new releases web page.

At this stage, there appears to be no change. This is because, when we introduced the style.css file, we only linked the index.html to that style sheet:  

~~~html
    <link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" media="screen" />
~~~

This linkage must be established in each html file. Introduce this into 'newreleases.html' now, and reload. You should see the class rule we just introduced come into play.

However, if you use the rule as shown above, you will still have a problem - as the 'newreleases.html' file is in a subdirectory of the folder containing the stylesheet. We will need to reflect this in the link element:

~~~html
    <link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="../style.css" media="screen" />
~~~

If you also want the heading 2 to be associated with the same paragraph class to be red in colour then you add an extra selector to your css rule

~~~css
h2.special, p.special
{
  color: red;
}
~~~

..and you add the class to the `<h2>` element in your html file.

~~~css
<h2 class="special">
~~~

If we were to continue adding elements to a class this will get to be a lengthy process so we can write a rule for all the elements in a class:

~~~css
.special
{
  color: red;
}
~~~

This will ensure that all elements of the "special" class are coloured red.

Your CSS might now be:

~~~CSS
body
{
  font-family:sans-serif;
}

h1, h2
{
  color: gray
}

h1
{
  border-bottom: 1px solid black;
}

em
{
  color:red;
}

p
{
  font-family:serif;
}

.special
{
  color: red;
}
~~~
