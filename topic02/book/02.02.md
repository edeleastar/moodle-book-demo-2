#CSS Inheritance

Currently our CSS file looks like this:

~~~css
body
{
  font-family:sans-serif;
}

h1, h2
{
  color: gray
}

h1
{
  border-bottom: 1px solid black;
}
~~~

Which produces the following style in the browser:

![](./img/x06.png)


Note the following text in our page:

~~~html
      This week we recommend <em>the Crazies</em>.  
~~~

This uses the `<em>` element, which introduces an emphasis style:

- <http://reference.sitepoint.com/html/em>

You may be able to see that this text is in italics.

We can introduce the following rule into our stylesheet (style.css) to target this specific element:

~~~css
em
{
  color:red;
}
~~~

Save the stylesheet and refresh the page in the browser. The text 'The Crazies' should be in red.

When experimenting with CSS, we often want to experiment with the effects we are introducing. Specifically, introducing some rules, and then perhaps removing them again to see the difference (if any).

Take the first rule in your stylesheet and 'comment out' the font rule:

~~~css
body
{
  /*font-family:sans-serif;*/
}
~~~

Save and reload. You should be able to notice the difference. This is called 'commenting' and is a common technique in both programming and web development. 'Uncomment' the rule again (remove the `/*` and `*/` symbols).

Now introduce the following rule:

~~~css
p
{
  font-family:serif;
}
~~~

Have a close look at the resultant page. What type of font is used by the headings? What type for the paragraphs? Can you explain the difference? Comment out the body font rule again (as we did above). What is the effect?
