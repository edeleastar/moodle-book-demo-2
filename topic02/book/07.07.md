      to rescue six Americans, which unfolded behind the scenes of the Iran hostage crisis,
      focusing on the little-known role that the CIA and Hollywood played-information that was not
      declassified until many years after the event.

The above content relies on a number of image files:

---

Save these three files to your computer. To do this, right click on each one in turn and select save as. Then you can drag and drop them directly into the images folder in your eclipse project.

If all this goes according to plan,  index page should now look something like this:
