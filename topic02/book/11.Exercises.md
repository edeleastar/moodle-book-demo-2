#Exercises

##Solution

This is a solution to the lab:

- [lab02.zip](./archives/lab02.zip)

##Exercise 1

In this lab you have experimented with classes:

- <http://reference.sitepoint.com/css/classselector>

Classes are one type of selector, with others listed here:

- <http://reference.sitepoint.com/css> (middle column)

Review the description of classes, and then have a look at Id selectors:

- <http://reference.sitepoint.com/css/idselector>

Where you are using Classes in this lab, try switching to using IDs

##Exercise 2

You might consider improving the look at feed of the directions page using the CSS features we have just covered. For instance:

- Use and unordered list (`<ol>`) instead of a series of paragraphs for each of the directions.

- Wrap this entire list is a `<div>` and style it somewhat similarly to the returns paragraph we just styled

- Find an image to represent the shop, and see if you can mimic the CSS rules we just deployed to move the image into a right hand column as we have with the sidebar.
